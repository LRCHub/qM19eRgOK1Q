Do you remember
when we fell in love
we were so young
and innocent then
do you remember
how it all began
it just seemed like
heaven so why did it end?
do you remember
back in the fall
we'd be together
all day long
do you remember
us holding hands
in each other's
eyes we'd stare
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
when we first met
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
Do you remember
how all used to talk
we'd stay on the phone
at night till dawn
do you remember
all the things we said
like I love you so
I'll never let you go
do you remember
back in the spring
every morning
birds would sing
do you remember
those special times
there'll just go on
and on in the back
of my mind
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
when we first met
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
those sweet memories
will always be dear to me
and girl no matter
what was said
I will never
forget what we had now baby
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
when we first met
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
do you remember the time
when we fell in love
do you remember the time
remember the times
ooh remember the times
do you remember girl
remember the times
on the phone you and me
remember the times
till dawn two or three
what about us girl
remember the times
do you, do you, do you
do you, do you
remember the times
in the park on the beach
remember the times
remember the times
remember the times
remember the times
remember the times
remember the times
