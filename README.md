[00:18.37] Do you remember
[00:20.98] When we fell in love
[00:23.29] We were young and innocent then
[00:27.37] Do you remember
[00:29.50] How it all began
[00:32.13] It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
[00:55.13] 
[00:36.41] Do you remember (I bet you remember)
[00:38.91] Back in the fall (I bet you remember)
[00:41.18] We'd be together all day long (I bet you remember)
[00:44.90] Do you remember (I bet you remember)
[00:47.35] Us holding hands (I bet you remember)
[00:49.85] In each other's eyes, we'd stare (I bet you remember)
[00:53.55] Tell me
[00:57.05] 
[00:54.55] Do you remember the time?
[00:57.18] When we fell in love
[00:58.92] Do you remember the time?
[01:01.42] When we first met, girl
[01:03.63] Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
[01:06.39] When we fell in love
[01:07.93] Do you remember the time?
[01:20.43] 
[01:12.10] Do you remember how we used to talk?
[01:16.82] You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
[01:20.94] Do you remember all the things we said?
[01:25.78] Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"
[01:47.78] 
[01:29.87] Do you remember (I bet you remember)
[01:31.95] Back in the spring? (I bet you remember)
[01:34.39] Every morning, birds would sing (I bet you remember)
[01:38.53] Do you remember (I bet you remember)
[01:40.87] Those special times? (I bet you remember)
[01:43.26] They'll just go on and on
[01:45.65] In the back of my mind
[01:56.65] 
[01:47.73] Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
[01:50.75] When we fell in love
[01:52.44] Do you remember the time?
[01:54.60] When we first met, girl
[01:57.16] Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
[01:59.87] When we fell in love
[02:01.21] Do you remember the time?
[02:13.71] 
[02:05.48] Those sweet memories
[02:10.05] Will always be dear to me
[02:14.61] And girl no matter what was said
[02:18.83] I will never forget what we had
[02:22.41] Now baby
[02:26.41] 
[02:23.87] Do you remember the time? (Do you remember?)
[02:26.59] When we fell in love
[02:27.89] Do you remember the time?
[02:30.19] When we first met, girl
[02:32.42] Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
[02:35.33] When we fell in love
[02:36.78] Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
[02:59.28] 
[02:41.75] Do you remember the time? ('Cause I remember)
[02:44.34] When we fell in love
[02:45.80] Do you remember the time? (All in my mind, girl)
[02:50.29] Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
[02:53.12] When we fell in love
[02:54.68] Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
[03:17.18] 
[02:59.55] Remember the time (Ooh!)
[03:03.52] Remember the time
[03:06.21] Do you remember, girl?
[03:08.62] Remember the time
[03:10.59] On the phone, you and me
[03:12.97] Remember the time
[03:14.05] 'Til dawn, two or three
[03:15.64] What about us, girl?
[03:25.64] 
[03:17.51] Remember the time
[03:19.55] Do you, do you, do you?
[03:22.00] Remember the time (Do you, do you?)
[03:24.58] In the park, on the beach
[03:26.36] Remember the time
[03:27.18] You and me, in Spain
[03:28.84] What about, what about
[03:30.88] Remember the time
[03:39.38] 
[03:34.82] Remember the time
[03:37.05] Ooh! In the park
[03:39.56] Remember the time
[03:40.31] After dark, do you, do you, do you?
[03:43.95] Remember the time (Do you, do you)
[03:46.45] Do you, did you?
[03:48.43] Remember the time
[03:50.18] Yeah, yeah, woo!
[03:53.04] Remember the time, remember the time
